## 1Ô∏è‚É£ SSH Key Setup & VS Code Remote

```bash
# Generate a new SSH key (if needed)
ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C "your_email@example.com"

# Add your public key to the DO server
ssh-copy-id -i ~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub root@206.189.30.236

# (Optional) Check your key fingerprint
ssh-keygen -lf ~/.ssh/id_ed25519

# Add to ~/.ssh/config for easy access
cat <<EOF >> ~/.ssh/config
Host helix-do
    HostName 206.189.30.236
    User root
    IdentityFile ~/.ssh/id_ed25519
EOF

# Connect with VS Code Remote SSH (select 'helix-do')
```

## 2Ô∏è‚É£ Copy Files & Folders (SCP)

```bash
# Copy a script
scp helix-service-discovery.sh helix-do:/root/helix-hub/

# Copy a whole folder
scp -r helix-core helix-do:/root/helix-hub/
```

## 3Ô∏è‚É£ Deploy Services (Docker Compose)

```bash
# Start only the low-resource stack
docker compose up -d traefik vault filebrowser helix-core

# Stop all containers
docker compose down
```
