---
Based on the list of services you're running, it looks like you’ve set up a versatile and modular self-hosted infrastructure, likely for development, automation, file management, and possibly secure access control. Here’s a breakdown of what each service does and what I would do with them together:

---

### 🧠 **helix-hub / helix-core** 

* **Image:** `helix/helix-core:dev`
* **Port:** `5000`
* **Services:** 
  - 🎪 **FaaF Academy** - Career coaching platform with "Failure as a Feature" philosophy
  - 🏦 **Helix Core** - Banking file processing system (MT940, BAI2, CAMT053)
* **Routes:**
  - `/` - FaaF Academy Landing Page (Professional career coaching SaaS)
  - `/demo` - FaaF Academy Live Demo (Template testing interface) 
  - `/helix` - Helix Dashboard (Banking operations monitoring)
* **Business Model:** $10k-100k+ annual revenue potential through career coaching subscriptions
* **What to do:** 
  - **Career Coaching SaaS:** Use FaaF Academy for professional coaching with specialized templates
  - **Banking Integration:** Process financial files with enterprise-grade routing engine

---

### 🔐 **keycloak**

* **Image:** `keycloak/keycloak:23.0.1`
* **Port:** `8081:8080`
* **Use:** Identity and Access Management (IAM).
* **What to do:** Set it up as your **centralized authentication provider** using OpenID Connect or SAML. Integrate it with n8n, Vault, Filebrowser, etc. for **SSO (Single Sign-On)**.

---

### 🛢️ **postgres**

* **Image:** `postgres:14-alpine`
* **Use:** Database backend.
* **What to do:** Use this as your main **database backend** for services like n8n or custom applications. Optimize for size and performance, given it's the Alpine version.

---

### ⚙️ **n8n**

* **Image:** `n8nio/n8n:1.19.4`
* **Port:** `5678`
* **Use:** Automation and workflow orchestration.
* **What to do:** Build **automated workflows** that connect your tools (e.g., trigger workflows when a file is added to Filebrowser, or when a Git commit happens in Helix Core).

---

### 📁 **filebrowser**

* **Image:** `filebrowser/filebrowser:latest`
* **Port:** `8082:80`
* **Use:** Web UI for file management.
* **What to do:** Use it to **browse, upload, and manage files** on your server easily. Integrate with n8n to trigger actions based on file changes.

---

### 💼 **vault**

* **Image:** `hashicorp/vault:1.15.2`
* **Port:** `8200`
* **Use:** Secrets management.
* **What to do:** Use Vault to **securely store API keys, tokens, passwords**, etc. Integrate with n8n, Helix, or even custom apps for dynamic secrets.

---

### 🌐 **traefik**

* **Image:** `traefik:v2.10`
* **Port:** `8080`
* **Use:** Reverse proxy and load balancer.
* **What to do:** Set it up as your **central ingress controller**, handling HTTPS (via Let's Encrypt), routing, and service discovery. Cleanly expose all your services under different subdomains.

---

### 💬 **ollama**

* **Image:** `ollama/ollama:latest`
* **Port:** `11434`
* **Use:** Local LLM (like running LLaMA models).
* **What to do:** Deploy LLMs locally for **offline AI inference**. Use with n8n to build smart automations, or integrate it with chat interfaces (Slack, Telegram bots, etc.).

---

### 📡 **sftp-demo**

* **Image:** `atmoz/sftp:latest`
* **Port:** `2222:22`
* **Use:** SFTP server.
* **What to do:** Use it for **secure file uploads**, e.g., as a staging area for clients or collaborators. N8n can poll this for new files to process.

---

### 🔁 How to Use Them Together

Here’s a scenario of how these could all work in a real-world setup:

1. **File Upload & Automation:**

   * User uploads a file via **SFTP**.
   * **n8n** detects this via cron or filesystem trigger.
   * n8n processes the file, stores metadata in **PostgreSQL**, and archives it to **Filebrowser**.
   * Secrets/API keys used in the process are pulled securely from **Vault**.

2. **SSO & Access Control:**

   * All web-based services (n8n, Filebrowser, Helix, etc.) authenticate through **Keycloak** using OIDC.
   * Admins manage users centrally.

3. **DevOps & Code Management:**

   * Developers commit code to **Helix Core**.
   * n8n or custom scripts can trigger builds or deployments.

4. **AI Integration:**

   * A workflow in **n8n** sends text to **Ollama** for summarization or analysis.
   * Useful for processing customer emails, logs, etc.

5. **Frontend Exposure:**

   * **Traefik** serves all apps securely over HTTPS, under nice subdomains like:

     * `n8n.example.com`
     * `vault.example.com`
     * `ollama.example.com`

---

### 🧰 Final Notes

If you’re not already doing this, consider:

* Adding **backups** (n8n, Postgres, Vault data especially).
* Monitoring tools (like Grafana/Prometheus).
* Setting up logging (e.g., Loki + Promtail or ELK stack).
* Regular updates (some images seem slightly out of date).

Would you like help building out the `traefik.yml` config or wiring n8n with these services?
